                <h3>5 Reasons Why Changing the LBW Laws would be a Poor Move</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/cricket1.jpg"  width="30%"/><br>
                    As I get ready for another Monday with coffee in hand, I stare in disbelief at my computer screen. Sitting there, I am wondering if ESPNCricinfo are so out of ideas during the COVID-19 pandemic that they have turned to satirical articles.

                    But, I realise that ESPNCricinfo don’t really do satirical articles. Plus, Ian Chappell isn’t the kind of guy to write them.
                    
                    Chappell, a tough cricketer and possessor of one of the finest minds of the game, has suggested cricket changes its LBW laws once it returns. Specifically, he says that it shouldn’t matter where the ball pitches or hits the batsman; if the umpire thinks it’ll hit the stumps, you’re out.

                <p><img src="./images/Cricket2.jpg"  width="30%"/><br>There is no doubt that Fantasy Platforms such as Dream11 have changed the way we engage with cricket.

But, in these times where cricket has come to a standstill due to COVID-19, how could you still put those Dream11 skills to good use?

                <p><img src="./images/cricket4.jpg"  width="30%"/><br>
                    Cricket is a numbers game as much as it is a mental battle. We cricket fans are obsessed with numbers, no matter how much we like or dislike math class. After all, cricket provides interesting mathematics that forms the basis for most arguments.

                    From averages to big totals to magnificent individual achievements, I will explore 10 cricket records that are unlikely to be broken anytime soon. Given the cricketing world moves at such a fast pace these days (remember the 2019 World Cup, anyone), “anytime soon” could mean 5-10 years from now.  <a href="https://cricblog.net/10-cricket-records-unlikely-to-be-broken-anytime-soon/">Read More...</a>

                <h3>What makes Jasprit Bumrah so special?</h3> 
                <p><img src="./images/cricket5.jpg"  width="30%"/><br>
                    Jasprit Bumrah has it on a string. In Antigua, the first Test of India’s 2019 tour of West Indies, India’s premier bowler had the inswinger on point to the left handers. Just days later in Jamaica, he had the ball going the other way, with minimal change in action or body position.

Like Antigua, he’s too good for the West Indies batsmen. Poor John Campbell and Darren Bravo are caught behind the wicket having not done too much wrong. After Bravo is dismissed, it is pure chaos. The ball cannons into both Shamarh Brooks and Roston Chase’s front pads. Most, including Bumrah, thought the hat-trick ball to Chase was heading down the legside. However, Virat Kohli decided to review with great effect, with Bumrah becoming the third Indian to take a Test hat-trick. In just his 12th Test.
